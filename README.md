        <h2> Introduction</h2>
        <p> <ol><li>One of the most well-known reef fish is the queen angelfish (Holacanthus ciliaris). 
            One of the 86 species of angelfish, which are most closely related to butterflyfish, 
            they are an angelfish. </li><br>
           <li> The blue angelfish and the queen angelfish resemble each other the most (Holacanthus bermudensis).</li><br>
            <li> The fact that they are embellished with an electric blue circular "crown" is 
            the most noticeable aesthetic distinction. Their name comes from the location of it in the center of their head.</li></ol></p>

            <h2 id="Characteristics and Appearance">  1. Characteristics and Appearance</h2>
            <p1>One of the most beautiful reef fish is the queen angelfish. 
                Despite the fact that they appear noticeable due to their vibrant color,
                 they actually mix in nicely with the other brightly colored reef species.</p1>
                <h3> Weight and Height</h3>
                <p1> The length and weight of a queen angelfish can reach 18 inches (45 cm) and 3.5 pounds, respectively (1.6 kg).</p1>
                <h3>Physical Characteristics & Color</h3>
                <p1>Pomacanthidae is the family name for angelfish, and it is derived from the Greek words for thorn and cover (akantha).
            The preopercle spines that cover their gills and enable them to breathe and feed are referred to as the "thorn cover."<br><br>
            <h4>With the help of this image you can easily find the gender of queen angelfish. This image describe differences between 
                male and female queen angel fish by differentiating their body parts.</h4>
                <img src="fish1.png"><br><br><br>
           
                    As they age, queen angelfish develop new colours. Between the head and tail fin of juvenile angelfish, there is a 
                    dark-brown or black patch that is primarily bright yellow in colour.<br><br>
As it ages, the brown and black will become lighter until they eventually vanish and turn yellow. A queen angelfish's natural colour
 is a golden yellow. Its dorsal and anal fins have electric cerulean blue or aqua accents. Occasionally the trim is done in both hues.
  Also typical are accents in iridescent orange and purple. Several of them have aqua and cerulean blue stripes.<br><br>

Their tails are significantly longer than their dorsal and anal fins, which flow wildly behind them.
The circular, crown-like feature in the centre of the forehead gives queen angelfish their name.
<h4>This image shows the different parts of the queen angel fish such dorsal fin, fin rays etc.</h4>
<center> <img src="fish2.png" ></center><br><br><br>

This "crown" may also resemble a giant eye, fooling predators into believing the fish is larger than it actually is. 
They have tiny teeth that resemble bristles and beak-like jaws. Sometimes, their mouths turn blue.<br><br>
The gill cowls of queen angels are covered in thick spines. Their dorsal fins have 14 spines and 19–21 soft rays,
 and their anal fins have three spines and 20–21 soft rays.<br><br>

                <h4>In this image it illustrates that how queen angel fish mating with blue angelfish and create a new species that is Townsend angelfish.</h4>
                <img src="fish3.png" height="400" ><br><br>
<p1>In the wild or in captivity, queen angelfish can live for 15 to 20 years with the right care. During mating, queen angelfish come
in contact with one another while their abdomens are virtually touching. They substitute broadcast spawning instead. 
 While the male releases his sperm, the female releases 25,000–75,000 eggs into the ocean.<br><br>

Eggs that have been released into the water column above the reef are more likely to fertilise without being eaten by reef predators.<br>
Queen angelfish can release up to 10 million eggs in a single spawning season. After fertilisation, 15 to 20 hours later,
 their transparent eggs hatch.
The huge yolk sac of the larva is digested in about 48 hours, and the larvae then begin to acquire swimming abilities.
Next, it requires 3–4 weeks before the juveniles are ready to come down to the reef to live.

</p1><br>
<h2 id="Habitat">3. Habitat</h2><br>
<p1>
    The Caribbean Sea and western Atlantic Ocean are home to rugged and warm-water coral reefs where queen angelfish can be found.
<h3> Where Does the Queen Angelfish Live?</h3>
Their range extends from the eastern coast of Mexico and Central America all the way down to the coastal regions of eastern Florida and 
the Gulf of Mexico. They also flourish near the nations and islands of the Caribbean and along the north and east coasts of South America.<br> <br>
While adult queen angels are benthic, dwelling at the lowest ocean level, juvenile queen angels begin life in the sea deep above the coral reef.
Mature angelfish can only be found in the shallowest areas of coral reefs, hence they are often found in water depths between three and 230 feet (1 and 70 m).
</p1><br><br>
<h2 id="Food & Diet">4. Food & Diet</h2>
<p1>Angelfish eat a range of items on the coral reef.<br><br>
    Queen angelfish larvae only eat plankton before moving down to the reef to live. Juvenile queen angelfish consume
     parasites and filamentous algae off of larger fish after they get to the reef.<br><br>
    
    Fish with parasites routinely visit the medical spa established in the seagrass by young queen angelfish to get their parasites removed.
    Mature queen angelfish eat virtually exclusively sponges that they come across near the coral reef. Yet, they are also foragers who 
    consume a wide range of crustaceans and sessile reef plants.<br><br>
    
    Some of their favourite snacks include algae, hydroids, bryozoans, soft corals, sea fans, tunicates, anemones, jellyfish, and loose organic debris
    The pet queen angelfish will consume flake food, spirulina, and other algae.They need to eat three times a day.

<h2 id="Threats & Predators">6. Threats & Predators</h2>
<p1><h3> Human Threats</h3>
    Humans who take them for the aquarium trade and huge reef predators are the main threats to queen angelfish.<br><br>
    They take queen angelfish for the aquarium trade since they are common in saltwater tanks. More than anywhere else, Brazil 
    is where they are harvested the most.<br><br>
    There is a harvest management strategy in place to prevent overharvesting of queen angels. Collectors
     are limited to 10,000 specimens in Brazil.<br><br>
    This quota, nevertheless, is much higher than what is already being collected.
     The amount collected will be roughly 44,000 in five years.<br><br>
    Queen angelfish are rarely caught by humans for food. Intake can result in Ciguatera toxicity,
     which can cause stomach problems and weak arms and legs.<br><br>
    <h3>Climate Change & Global Warming</h3>Coral reef damage is posing an increasing threat to queen angelfish.
     Restoration efforts can keep coral reefs from going extinct. 
    Protected, fortunately, they live in a world in which they can live anywhere they want.<br><br>
    <h3> Predator</h3>The main predators of queen angelfish are larger fish. Sharks and barracudas are among their predators.

    Queen angels are able to crawl between corals to more readily elude large reef predators thanks to their small, 
    laterally compressed body structure.<br><br>
    <h3>Other Predators</h3>Because of its distinctive and variable color patterns, the queen angelfish population at 
    St. Paul's Rocks in Brazil is the most vulnerable to overfishing for the aquarium trade.
    But, given that the island is 1,000 miles from shore, obtaining queen angels from there is an expensive investment.<br><br>

<h2 id="Fun Facts About Queen Angelfish">8. Fun Facts About Queen Angelfish</h2>
<p1><ul><li> Unlike some other angelfish species, queen angelfish are bashful. They typically exist alone or in long-term monogamous pairs.
    As Queen Angelfish get old, the younger Angelfish helps them out!<br><br></li>
    <li>  Especially while mating, they can communicate with one another by altering their hue. To entice the female to mate, 
    males flick their pectoral fins outward and flaunt them.<br><br></li>
    <li>  Young angelfish are just 0.59 to 0.79 inches (12–20 mm) length when they first descend to the reef to live.<br><br></li>
    <li> In Bermuda, all queen angelfish are hybrids that are descended from blue angelfish (Holacanthus bermudensis).</li><br>
    <li> This hybrid is named Townsend Angelfish (Holacanthus cilaris).<br><br></li>
    <li> The pectoral fins of queen angelfish are used for swimming.<br><br></li>
    <li>The lateral line, a network of fluid-filled tubes in the body of angelfish,
     provides them with the ability to detect minute vibrations in the water caused by approaching predators.<br><br></li>
     <li>Although all angelfish are protogynous hermaphrodites, females have the ability to transform into active
     males in the absence of males.<br><br></li>
     <li>Angelfish are resilient and can adjust to water that has an imperfect pH and hardness.<br><br></li>
     <li> In captivity, queen angelfish require a tank that is at least 100 gallons in size, preferably one that is 180 gallons or larger.
     The minimum tank size for pairs is 220 gallons.<br><br></li></p1>
